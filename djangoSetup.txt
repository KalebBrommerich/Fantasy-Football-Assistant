run this => pip install virtualenv
then this => virtualenv env
run these (also install the rest of the packages incase they aren't already in the virtualenv) => pip install django
then this but shouldn't need to cause in this project I ran it already => django-admin startproject FFAssistant 
same as above => python manage.py startapp myapp
to start web server do this =>cd .\FFAssistant     
then this => python manage.py runserver
terminate virtualenv by running => deactivate

To run any python files in the virtualenv you need to do it manually in terminal (python GUI.py)
start virtualenv again by running .\env\Scripts\activate in root dir
